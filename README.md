    Class 09 lab:  
        This mini project is an extension of the Subtype Polymorphism lab, written by SamR and
        completed by myself and Livia Stein Freitas in class.
        
    Class 02 lab: 
        HorizontallyFlipped.reverseRow(String row) is an adaptation of the rev(int[] arr) method
        myself and Audrey Trinh wrote in the Class 2 lab.
        
    Unit testing notes:
        I reviewed the reading on JUnit and unit testing when writing TextBlockTests.java.
    
    Subtype polymorphism notes:
        I consulted the reading and lab for subtype polymorphism throughout this project.
    
    SamR office hours:
        SamR figured out why the classpath configuration was readonly.
